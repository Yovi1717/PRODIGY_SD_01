Proud to Share My First Project at Prodigy InfoTech! 🌡️

I've recently developed a user-friendly Java program to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This utility provides an efficient way to handle temperature conversions with clear prompts and outputs. By leveraging Java and its core libraries, I managed to create a practical tool for various applications.

📊 Key Highlights:
* User interaction through console prompts
* Temperature conversion functions
* Clear and formatted display of conversion results

🔧 Technical Skills Demonstrated:
* Java programming
* Basic user input handling
* Function implementation for temperature conversions
* Console-based user interface design

Big Thank you to Prodigy InfoTech
